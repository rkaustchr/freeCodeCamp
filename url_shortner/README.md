Objective: Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: https://little-url.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Heroku project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit https://freecodecamp.com/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

User Story: I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.

User Story: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.

User Story: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
